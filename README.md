During the development of this project, I mastered the fetch function in JavaScript, enabling dynamic data retrieval. This not only enhanced the functionality of the Currency Converter but also opened doors to handling asynchronous requests and real-time data updates.

Feel free to explore the project, learn from the code, and adapt it to your needs. Happy coding! üöÄüîß

**Note:** For real-time exchange rate data, the application uses the [Currency API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api).
